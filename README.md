# super-simple-stock-market
* The program is a maven project based on spring boot with three modules: domain, api and business
* Domain lists all domain classes, API contains all service interfaces and Business module contains all the business logic
* It has been completely developed using TDD, hence you can start directly from Business module test cases.
* Just to make it easier, I have categorized test files based on all 5 requirements, i.e. dividend yield, pe ratio, record trade, volume weighted price and geometric mean.
* Have used Java 7.
